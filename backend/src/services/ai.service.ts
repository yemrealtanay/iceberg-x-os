The "${title}" mission has progressed through research and active prototyping. Cubes successfully developed a proof of concept addressing the core requirements, showing good technical exploration and initial system design.

### Key Findings & Milestones
- Successfully established the core workflow and data pipelines.
- Integrated LLM/NLP classification libraries to automate manual query tagging.
- Resolved token chunking errors during data parsing.

### Identified Risks
- Database queries take >500ms on text searches, which will degrade performance at scale.
- Team member availability might decrease during exam periods.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Optimize database indexes on the query log tables.
2. Prepare presentation slides for the upcoming Demo Day review.`;

The team successfully built a functional MVP for the "${title}" demo, validating the core technology loop. However, the reflection highlights crucial performance gaps that need to be addressed before productizing.

### Key Lessons Learned
- **Architecture**: Separating LLM classification into a microservice improves modularity but increases network latency.
- **Testing**: Pre-filling database seed data saves massive dev time during manual feature testing.

### Suggested Improvement Actions
1. **Performance Profiling**: Set up index profiling in PostgreSQL to reduce query lookup time.
2. **Communication**: Set up weekly syncs earlier to prevent integration bottlenecks between frontend and backend developers.`;
